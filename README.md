# visitor-pin-board
**This application is under development.**

This application is for allowing tourist visitors to specify where they are from and their purpose for visit. It serves the purpose of 
replacing paper based form and physical pin board maps with an electronic version, while maitaining the simplicity and easy workflow for
users.
It complements an admin dashboard that allows administrators to view, edit and analyze the data regarding the visits. For example, it can 
be used to find which place is getting more visitors, which can be helpful for advertising purposes.
